                    Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love.
                    Rather, itâ€™s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.

                    <li><strong>Choose whole grains:</strong> Opt for whole-grain bread, pasta, rice, and oats over refined grains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Include lean protein:</strong> Good sources include fish, poultry, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit unhealthy fats:</strong> Reduce saturated and trans fats. Choose healthy unsaturated fats from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil.</li>
